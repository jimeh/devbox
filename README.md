This repo contains the [Vagrant][] and [Chef][] setup for the Ubuntu 12.04 VM
I use locally for various development, experiments, and other just for fun
things.

Additionally, it's also been a playground for me to play with both Puppet and
Chef provisioning tools, eventually settling on Chef. As such there's probably
a lot of stupid things in my Chef setup, and if you spot anything please let
me know if you can be bothered :)
